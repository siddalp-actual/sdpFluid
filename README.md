# sdpFluid
My Raspberry Pi configuration for using Pi4 as a midi synth with my SDP-3 keyboard.

See [this blog entry](https://siddalp-actual.github.io/jekyll-now/SDP/) for a discussion and notes on how I got here.

 | Path | Remarks |
  --- | --- 
 | orig/ | contains the original configuration files which I've altered |
 | src/  | contains the current versions |
 | install.sh | destroys what's there, and links the files in src/ into the Pi config |
